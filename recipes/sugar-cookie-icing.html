  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sugar cookie icing dries hard and shiny and the colors stay bright. Choose as many different food colorings as you desire. This recipe makes enough icing to decorate a dozen sugar cookies.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1 cup of confectioners' sugar</strong>: This sugar cookie icing starts with confectioners' sugar (also known as powdered or icing sugar), which creates a smoother texture than granulated sugar.</li>
      <li><strong>2 teaspoons of milk</strong>: Whole milk thins the icing and ensures a spreadable, easy-to-work-with consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>2 teaspoons of corn syrup</strong>: Light corn syrup adds shine and helps the icing harden.</li>
      <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon of almond extract</strong>: A dash of clear almond extract lends subtle nutty flavor. You can substitute vanilla extract if you like (make sure to use clear extract if you're going for a bright white color).</li>
      <li><strong>Food Coloring (Optional)</strong>: Depending on how you plan to decorate your cookies, you might want to add a few drops of food coloring or food gel.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Stir together confectioners' sugar and milk in a small bowl until smooth.</li>
      <li>Beat in corn syrup and almond extract until icing is smooth and glossy. If icing is too thick, add more corn syrup.</li>
      <li>Divide into separate bowls, and add food colorings to each to desired intensity.</li>
      <li>Dip cookies, or paint them with a brush.</li>
    </ol>
